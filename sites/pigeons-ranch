{:.abstract} Pigeons ranch is located by Glorieta, New Mexico. The ranch was a hidden gem for travelers to take a break from traveling the Santa Fe trail during 1822, but also served as a battle field between the Union and the Confederate troops during the Civil War in 1862. This small ranch truly is a hidden treasure of American History that should be remembered and preserved, but research and records of this historic ranch are uncommon.
