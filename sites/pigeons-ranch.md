{:.abstract}The Town of Glorieta is an important town to New Mexico because it served as the battle ground for two major battles of New Mexico history, One of them being the *The Battle of Glorieta Pass*. The same battle that partially took place on *Pigeons ranch*. Pigeons Ranch is located near Glorieta, New Mexico. The ranch was a hidden gem for travelers to take a break from traveling the Santa Fe trail during 1822, but also served as a battle field between the Union and the Confederate troops during the Civil War in 1862. This small ranch truly is a hidden treasure of American History that should be remembered and preserved, but research and records of this historic ranch are uncommon. Today, you can get to the ranch by taking exit 299 in Glorieta from I-25 North, and then turning left on NM-50, and Pigeons Ranch will be on the Left peaking through the bushes from the side of the road.

### Pigeons Ranch 
Pigeons Ranch, originally called “Rancho de Glorieta” is 18 miles southeast of Santa Fe, halfway through the Glorieta Pass[](). It was owned by Alexander Pigeon, a French man, who later renamed himself to Alejandro Valle. He purchased a land grant for 5,275 pesos, about $257.00 today, in 1851-52 and built a trading post and home on the land which still remain today.  During the Days of the Santa Fe trail, the ranch served as rest stop for travelers who were able to grab a bite to eat, rest, and feed their animals. The ranch was similar to today’s idea of a Motel. There is no recorded images or descriptions of the ranch before the Civil War in 1862.
